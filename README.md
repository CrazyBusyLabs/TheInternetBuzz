The Internet Buzz
---
An ASP.net application to get the latest buzz words on the internet and trying to explain why these are buzzing.

**CURRENTLY NOT CHANGING**

This project was started as a learning experience for me to keep my skills up to date with ASP.net, and I welcome anyone else in the web development community to play with it :) I also used it to practice my SEO skills. I pushed the limit and got ban from google indexing in a domain name and I am now using http://www.theinternetbuzz.com
