The Internet Buzz
---
An ASP.net application to get the latest buzz words on the internet and trying to explain why these are buzzing.

This project was started as a learning experience for me to keep my skills up to date with ASP.net, and I welcome anyone else in the web development community to play with it :) I also used it to practice my SEO skills.
