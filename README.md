The Internet Buzz
---
A ASP.net applicaiton to get the latest buzz words on the internet and trying to explain why they are buzzing.

**CURRENTLY NOT CHANGING**

This project was started as a learning experience for me to keep my skills up to date with ASP.net, and I welcome anyone else in the web development community to play with it :)
